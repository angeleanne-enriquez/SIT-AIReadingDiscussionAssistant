# <p align="center"> AI Reading Discussion Assistant
> Stevens Pinnacle Research Program - Summer 2024

## Project Goal
This project aims to assist online learning by having an AI tool generate text summaries, reading questions, and professional reading-based discussions. I developed an AI, Python application using Claude AI's API and implementing a modern GUI with CustomTkinter. There, a user can upload their own text and ask for a summary, reading-based questions, or a discussion between different AI personas. To test this program, I used a tennis case study and ensured the results were appropriate for the task. I also contributed to a research paper, detailing my programming journey and how I overcame any obstacles.

## How to Use
1. Download the Python program.
3. Replace the API key with your own.
4. Open the Python program and look throughout the program to learn how to use the other features.

## Challenges
A huge challenge for this project was ensuring Claude's API would give consisently good results. Initially, I had difficulty with the program timing out or giving incomplete summaries/discussions. I solved this issue by refining my prompt engineering, keeping the instructions for the AI detailed but concise.
